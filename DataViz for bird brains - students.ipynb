For example, [crows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbSu2PXOTOc) make and use tools, [magpies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60Zg9sGnQf8) gather to mourn another's death, and [keas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bbWF6Gx8UM) produce a laughter-like vocalization when engaging in play that seems to be contagious. But how can a brain as small as a songbird's engage in complex problem solving and rich social regulation? Based on the results of this study, part of what explains advanced avian cognition is that bird brains pack a high density of brain cells.\n",
