# Data Viz for Bird Brains

A Jupyter Notebook-based workshop on data visualization and machine learning basics created and led by [Sami Friedrich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sami-friedrich/) and [Alex Nevue](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandernevue/). This workshop was part of a peer-instructed Python course in 2018 at Oregon Health and Science University organized by Dr's [Stephen David](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-david-a264794/) and [Brad Buran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bburan/). Teacher, student, and answer notebook versions are derived from the base notebook file.

## Introduction
This workshop demonstrates some of the neat ways to explore and display data using `matplotlib`, `seaborn` and `bokeh`. Then it introduces `scikit-learn`, and the power of classifiers to make predictions. 

The dataset used throughout this workshop is from a study published in 2016 by Olcowicz et al. titled 
[Birds have primate-like numbers of neurons in the forebrain](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/06/07/1517131113). It is predominantly composed of brain cell counts from multiple brain areas of different bird species. 

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the unique benefits of `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `bokeh` data visualization packages
- Enrich data storytelling using `seaborn` to encode additional variables and improve readability in plots
- Create engaging, interactive & responsive plots using `bokeh`
- Implement the 4-step method to instantiate, fit, predict, and evaluate models using `scikit-learn`
- Generate predictive classifiers using a k-nearest neighbors approach
